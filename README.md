- 👋 Hi, my name is Azur Causevic and I am currently (until the end of April 2024) a Master's student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, data science, machine learning, optimization, control, and engineering - in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my master thesis titled "Deep Efficient Transfer Learning Optimization".
- 📫 How to reach me: azur.causevic@tum.de / azur.causevic@bmw.de (until the end of April 2024) / a.cause@outlook.de
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My thesis' title is not the one mentioned above :P
- 😉 Important NOTE: Most of the repositories here contained unstructured, semi-functional code. The thought behind it is to showcase
the fact that learning is a process and that the journey might take a while. Maybe one day I will do an update, but as of now, I would
like to show people that the passion and amazing product is built upon hours, days, months, maybe even years of struggle and learning.
