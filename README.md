- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Azur Causevic and I am currently Doctoral student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, data science, machine learning, optimization, control, and engineering - in general.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: azur.causevic@tum.de / azur.ca.causevic@bmw.de / a.cause@outlook.de
- ðŸ˜‰ Important NOTE: Most of the repositories here contained unstructured, semi-functional code. The thought behind it is to showcase
the fact that learning is a process and that the journey might take a while. Maybe one day I will do an update, but as of now, I would
like to show people that the passion and amazing product is built upon hours, days, months, maybe even years of struggle and learning.
